# circleTransport

**Toy problem: Transport on the circle**

Designed to mimic E3SM transport on the circle.

## Getting started

- Set up a virtual environment for this project:
```
  cd circleTransport
  python -m venv .venv
  . .venv/bin/activate
```

- Make sure you have a good python configuration. Ideally, simply running `pip3 install -r requirements-dev.txt` should be enough to get these scripts running.
- Install the pre-commit hooks: `pre-commit install`
